# Tetris SFML
A Tetris game built using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) while following through [@FamTrinli's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH_omFPqMO4&list=PLB_ibvUSN7mzUffhiay5g5GUHyJRO4DYr&index=2) *Let's Make 16 Games* series.

The `Makefile` is setup for a MacOS system with SFML installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
```bash
brew install sfml
```

If SFML is installed correctly, `make run` should compile and run the game ðŸ˜Ž
